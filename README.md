<h1>GA-Based Query Optimizer for Distributed Databases</h1>
<p>Welcome to GA Optimizer! This repository contains an implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based query optimizer for Distributed Database Systems (DDBS). The optimizer enhances query execution efficiency by exploring search space for <strong>JOOP</strong> by utilizing <strong>bushy trees</strong> and <strong>adaptive crossover</strong> strategies.</p>

<p>This project is part of my Masterâ€™s research at Victoria University of Wellington (VUW), where I focus on Genetic Algorithm-Based Query Optimization in DDBMS.</p>

<h2>ðŸ§© Key Features</h2>

<p>âœ… Genetic Algorithm for Query Optimization â€“ Uses evolutionary techniques to find efficient query execution plans.</p>
<p>âœ… Bushy Tree Support â€“ Enables parallelism and better execution plans beyond left-deep trees.</p>
<p>âœ… Adaptive Crossover Strategy â€“ Dynamically adjusts crossover rates to enhance solution quality.</p>
<p>âœ… Statistical Performance Evaluation â€“ Uses ANOVA, t-tests, and effect size analysis for validation.</p>
